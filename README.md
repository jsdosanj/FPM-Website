# FPM-Website
## Working on optimizing the Floatplane website by:
1. Lowering HTTP requests (if possible).
2. Combining CSS/JS files into 1 file each (no need for it).
3. Working on a fix for `Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 403 () https://frontend.floatplanecdn.com/2.7.20/assets/js/video/plugin/videojs-contrib-hlsjs.min.js.map'`Will look into this, and look for a work-around to the current setup.
4. Adding minor, but useful, features like: improving the scrolling animations, responsive images.
5. Minify CSS/JS/HTML to make code clean and readable.
